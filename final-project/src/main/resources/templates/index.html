            It is my belief that financial knowledge regarding the history of our economic system, how to save, invest, and better position oneâ€™s self for

        future success should be taught in school as a core subject matter just as math and reading are. This project is a website designed to provide anyone

        who wishes to learn more about these subject matters a basic foundation on which they can build upon. It provides links with more detailed information

        regarding the history of our current financial system, various ways of establishing a savings, how to maintain that savings, various investments, and

        how these things can aid one in positioning themselves for a more successful future. Charts, graphs, calculator tools, and wise sayings have been

        incorporated to make things easier, as well as memorable, for user.
