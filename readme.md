Financial Lessons for Beginners

##Elevator Pitch

It is my belief that financial knowledge regarding the history of our economic system, how to save, invest, and better position oneâ€™s self for
future success should be taught in school as a core subject matter just as math and reading are.  

This project is a website designed to provide anyone who wishes to learn 
more about these subject matters a basic foundation on which they can build upon.
 
It will provide links with more detailed information regarding the historyof our current financial system, various ways of establishing a savings,      how to maintain that savings, various investments, and how these things can aid one in positioning themselves for a more successful future. 
Charts, graphs, calculator tools, and wise sayings have been incorporated to make things easier as well as memorable for user.
